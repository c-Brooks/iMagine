Image processing for (my brand new) Mac

## Goal
This project is focused on tracking images through the webcam using OpenCV, a fun computer vision library.

My current idea is to add number recognition through the Machine Learning library supplied by OpenCV.  The user will be able to write numbers by gesturing to the webcam.
